# initjs
Use node js cli and UI to initialize your linux machine!

## Insperation

Ever had to reinstall your old faithful machine? Did your hard drive die after all that time you spent updating packages and figuring out everything you needed to do you stuff?

Well that is why I started this project, an easy to configure, full feature initialization library. All the tasks are specified in a JSON file that is storable and reusable. Each common task is a module, and additional asks can be added on.

This is a update to my other attempt to do this: [beeryardtech/init.git](https://github.com/beeryardtech/init.git).
